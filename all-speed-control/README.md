# Speed Control

This script allows the user to change the game speed during Debug/Test mode. By pressing F8, the game rotates between three speed settings (normal/high/low).
It is **compatible with RPG Maker XP, VX and VX Ace**.

It can be used many ways:
* **Speed up** the game to not waste time during tests
* **Slow down** the game to check animations and movements.

The following options can be changed at the beginning of the script:
* Speed change key (F8 by default)
* Low and High speed frame rate
* Disable pop-up texts
* Pop-up text contents when changing speed
